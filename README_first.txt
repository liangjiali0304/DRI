Congratulations on reaching the assessment! For this position, it's important that you are comfortable with SFTP,
linux systems, and working in the command line. You will notice that there are a bunch of nested directories.
The instructions and data needed to complete this assessment are hidden somewhere in the directory structure.
This assessment (SFTP included) is not meant to take more than 4 hours. Do not feel a need to over engineer anything.
Using a GUI to look through the empty directories will be difficult, we would hope
you are comfortable interacting with SFTP services and can search for the assessment files using tools such as pysftp,
but feel free to use whatever tool you like.
Best of luck! Please reach out if you have any questions to:
